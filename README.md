# Kirisame

## Important... stuff
I'm (trying to) modify this... And I might give up at any moment. So don't do anything to this repo, yet.

In the README and (probably) in the code, you'll see a lot of "ark", the original name of the repo, my fork is named "Kirisame", after the touhou project charctor. I'll try to change all the reference of "Ark" in the code without breaking it.

## Kirisame is available in three variants 

##### Kirisame
Not modified yet.. will update in the future, maybe

### Manual Installation

To build the theme the follwing packages are required 
* `autoconf`
* `automake`
* `pkg-config` or `pkgconfig` for Fedora
* `libgtk-3-dev` for Debian based distros or `gtk3-devel` for RPM based distros
* `git` to clone the source directory

**Note:** For distributions which don't ship separate development packages, just the GTK 3 package is needed instead of the `-dev` packages.

For the theme to function properly, install the following
* GNOME Shell 3.14 - 3.24, GTK 3.14 - 3.22
* The `gnome-themes-standard` package
* The murrine engine. This has different names depending on the distro.
  * `gtk-engine-murrine` (Arch Linux)
  * `gtk2-engines-murrine` (Debian, Ubuntu, elementary OS)
  * `gtk-murrine-engine` (Fedora)
  * `gtk2-engine-murrine` (openSUSE)
  * `gtk-engines-murrine` (Gentoo)

Install the theme with the following commands

#### 1. Get the source

Clone the git repository with

    git clone https://github.com/cheetosysst/arc-theme --depth 1 && cd arc-theme

#### 2. Build and install the theme

    ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
    sudo make install

Other options to pass to autogen.sh are

    --disable-transparency     disable transparency in the GTK3 theme
    --disable-light            disable Arc Light support
    --disable-darker           disable Arc Darker support
    --disable-dark             disable Arc Dark support
    --disable-cinnamon         disable Cinnamon support
    --disable-gnome-shell      disable GNOME Shell support
    --disable-gtk2             disable GTK2 support
    --disable-gtk3             disable GTK3 support
    --disable-metacity         disable Metacity support
    --disable-unity            disable Unity support
    --disable-xfwm             disable XFWM support

    --with-gnome=<version>     build the theme for a specific GNOME version (3.14, 3.16, 3.18, 3.20, 3.22)
                               Note 1: Normally the correct version is detected automatically and this
                               option should not be needed.
                               Note 2: For GNOME 3.24, use --with-gnome-version=3.22
                               (this works for now, the build system will be improved in the future)

After the installation is complete the theme can be activated with `gnome-tweak-tool` or a similar program by selecting `Arc`, `Arc-Darker` or `Arc-Dark` as Window/GTK+ theme and `Arc` or `Arc-Dark` as GNOME Shell/Cinnamon theme.

If the `--disable-transparency` option was used, the theme will be installed as `Arc-solid`, `Arc-Darker-solid` and `Arc-Dark-solid`.

## Troubleshooting

If you use Ubuntu with a newer GTK/GNOME version than the one included by default (i.e Ubuntu 14.04 with GTK 3.14 or Ubuntu 15.04 with GTK 3.16, etc.) the prebuilt packages won't work properly and the theme has to be installed manually as described above.
This is also true for other distros with a different GTK/GNOME version than the one included by default

If you get artifacts like black or invisible backgrounds under Unity, disable overlay scrollbars with

    gsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode normal
